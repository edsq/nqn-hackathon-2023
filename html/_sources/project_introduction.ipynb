    "The Fermi-Hubbard model is an important tool for studying the behavior of fermionic particles in atomic lattices. This has relevance to a variety of physical problems, especially the study of superconductivity and magnetism, and can also model the behavior of atoms suspended in an optical lattice. The objective of our project is to simulate the dynamics of spin-1/2 particles in a Fermi-Hubbard system with a same-site interaction between particles of opposing spin. The simulation shall be performed on a trapped ion quantum computer."

The operators ${\\hat{c}_{j}}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\hat{c}_{j}$ are second-quantized fermionic creation and annihilation operators. The terms in the first summation over the lattice sites represent the kinetic energy of particles in the model and their motion forward or backward along the lattice. The tunneling strength $J$ determines the likelihood of a fermion tunneling through the barrier between adjacent lattice sites. The terms in the second summation describe the interaction."
